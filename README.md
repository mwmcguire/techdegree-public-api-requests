# TTH Public API Requests - Employee Directory

Project 5 for TeamTreeHouse Full Stack Techdegree. This app is a prototype employee directory for a fictional company called Awesome Startup. It uses the Random User API to grab information for 12 random "employees," and display the data as individual cards. Clicking on a card will open a modal window with more detailed information. A search bar allows the user to search for an employee within the current directory.

Additional features:

- A "Get Random Employees" button allows the user to generate a new set of employees
- Errors are displayed by the search bar if the search value does not match a name within the directory
